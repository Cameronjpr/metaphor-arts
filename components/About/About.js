      <p>
        Peter Robson is an artist who paints surreal images, often presenting
        politically-driven events, to provoke questions on the decisions and
        actions of those in power and those that have grabbed power.

        He originates from the North-East of England and now lives in Hexham in
        Northumberland. However, he has travelled widely and has lived in
        London, Bradford and Derby to name a few along with Spain for a short
        time.

        He has always painted and working in Social and Probation settings has
        completely informed his creativity at times as did when he watched as a
        teenager the horrendous carpet bombing of Vietnam. After this 'dawn' he
        became politically active, which he does not separate from his
        creativity. Painting is how he documents the world and attempts to make
        sense of this.
